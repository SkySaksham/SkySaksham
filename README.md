## 🧠 About Me

- 🔭 Working on: **Long Numeric Arithmetic** , a C++ library for handling massive integers and decimals with custom high-precision arithmetic.  
- 💻 Built an **Expression Evaluator** in Python that mimics calculator logic.  
- 🚀 I enjoy building **Hackathon MVPs** and experimenting with “vibecode” projects fun ideas that blend logic and creativity.  
- 🌱 Always learning: algorithms, low-level computation, and full-stack development.  
- ⚡ Tech I’ve worked with: **FastAPI**, **Gemini API**, **NoSQL**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Render**, **Railway**, **Git**, **Figma**, **Supabase**, **Flutter**, and **Dart**.

## 🧭 Hackathon & MVP Building

💡 I love turning ideas into prototypes fast especially in hackathons.  
I’ve built chatbots, telemedicine apps, and AI-powered MVPs using:

- **FastAPI** + **Gemini API** for smart backend logic  
- **Flutter + Supabase** for full-stack cross-platform apps  
- **Render / Railway** for rapid cloud hosting  
- **Figma** for fast UI wireframes  
- **TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** for sleek frontend design  

🧠 Focused on *speed, simplicity, and real problem-solving.*
